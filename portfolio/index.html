                        <p class="date">Wednesday 11th October</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday, 11th October the group had a sprint meeting with the product owner. The meeting involved the planning the execution of the first 
                            sprint. The product owner made some requirements and tasks they would like in the solution. The team spoke to the product owner and identified 
                            the tasks that would take more effort than other tasks and tasks that may not be as essential as others. As the scrum leader, I had taken the 
                            leading parts of the conversation and expanded on tasks by asking how they would like specific tasks to be displayed to the user and how they 
                            would like them executed.<br> <br>

                            Following the meeting, our group strategically identified interdependent tasks and prioritized them. We then assigned tasks based on each group
                             member's strengths and weaknesses. To maintain efficiency, we opted to tackle one task at a time, allowing members to move on to the next one 
                             independently once completed. My assigned task involved normalizing the existing database, transforming the platform from static data to one
                              with foreign keys.<br> <br>
                            
                              Then, another group member and I made and tested a git hub repository for the solution, as it will ease the process of group members uploading code
                               at multiple points. Each group member has their own branch that they could make changes to, however, if they wanted to upload changes to the main 
                               solution, then it will need to be approved by another team member to ensure that no changes made will add errors to the main version.<br><br>

                        <h2>peer review, UI redesign & Normalisation of platform </h2>
                        <p class="date">Thursday 12th October</p>
                        <p> Before doing my task, I peer-checked and tested another group member's task before they merged their changes onto the existing solution (their task was to
                             migrate the current solution to entity framework Core), so it needed to be done first before any other task was completed. <br> <br>

                             I then made a more visually appealing and accessible UI to users, and started my task of normalization of the platform in the database and the API. I 
                             redesigned the database so the game table would take a foreign key from a platform table for a game platform rather than using static data for each game
                              platform. I had to remove the existing platform classes in the gameDTO.cs and game.cs and added different classes in them both that would inherit platform
                               information from classes from the new PlatformDTO.cs and Platform.cs. Both files are needed otherwise, platform information will not be gathered, I then had
                                add a DBSET to the GameDbContext.cs so the API could use the PlatformDTO and Platform.cs to make queys. When making the changes. I then had to edit the SQL
                                 game repository as a line was needed to include the platform with the game when outputting data, this was done by using the entity frame work function
                                .include . Finally I needed to make a mapper navigation method to that inherited the both PlatformDTO and the Game.cs that linked them together when they needed to
                                be used in a method. I found an error that prevented the data from going to the front end, so I left it till the next day.

                        <h2> Normalise platform</h2>
                        <p class="date">Friday 13th October</p>
                        <p>I identified the issue regarding the normalisation of the platform, the issue involved the Java script file that fetched the 
                            data from the API to the front end. I found that the Java script was not working because the API presented the data differently 
                            from how it used to before I added the task. To fix this, I had to reference the platform name with the word platform in the Javascript
                             (to get the platform, the Java script had to use Game.Platformname.Platformname). The reason the Java script has to reference the 
                             platform differently than what it used to is because of the Game.cs and GameDTO changes as they inherit the Plafrom.cs and DTO class,
                              so the JavaScript needs to be told to look in the platform DTO to get the platform name. <br><br>

                            I then had a group member look at my code to suggest any changes and test it to see if it was viable to the existing solution. 
                            Then, I merged my changes into the solution.</p>

                            <p>The other team need help when creating a place to store changes to their program and access their code since our group already had a

                        <p class="date">Thursday 19th October</p>
                        <p>I finished the search function and made it so a user can type a game title and the website shows all games with a smiler title. I first had to 
                            make a new method in the Game controller. The method uses the HTTPGet to find what the user has typed by using the URL. It looks for 'Title =' 
                            with what the user typed to determine what it is looking for, then I had to make a new method in the SQL game repository. The method made in 
                            the SQL game repository uses the entity frame work method '.contain' line to compare the title that the user with every game title. Then it 
                            takes the games that contain what the user typed after I had to inherit using Encapsulation the method in the interface game repository so 
                            the game controller can inherit the method and use it.<br><br>

                            To allow the front end to use the API, I first had to make a form in which a user can enter the game's title. The form uses the POST method so
                            the user input is stored in the URL when the page refreshes. The I needed to make a JavaScript file that uses a built-in function to search in
                            the URL for the title to then add the title to the fetch that the JavaScript uses to ask the API for all games that have that title.<br><br>
                            
                            Originally, in the SQL game repository, I was going to use the entity framework method '.where' rather than '.contains'; however, if this was 
                            implanted instead, it would mean that the user would need to type a name exactly to find the game they are looking for, and this would not be
                             user friendly.<br> <br>

                        <p>Merge errors happened when two group members merged their code to the main version as they did not follow the framework, because of this me and, another group member corrected and fixed
                             all the errors that were made after they merged to the main solution. We had to re-install all the auto mapper and entity framework extension files back to the solution as one group
                              member did not use auto mapper and didn't use the latest version of main, then one group member used the variable 'User' and the other group member used the variable 'Users' so we
                               had change the verbals to 'User' so all methods inherited 'User' rather than 'Users'. <br><br>

                            I also had to incorporate everyone's changes into one database, as three group members were working on different databases at one time. I then had to test it with everyone's parts of the
                             API to make sure that it was compatible with the whole solution.</p>

                        <p class="date">Saturday 28th October</p>
                        <p>When planning to work on displaying the average score against each game, I was going to make a method that could be used in the SQL game repository, however due to how the get game by title
                             method works, this would not be possible, so I opted for changing each current name method to get data on a game.<br><br>

                            I first had to remove the score entity from the game table in the database, as the score for each game will be determined by each review for that game. I then added a score element to the 
                            review table. The score element will store a number that a user gives a game, the number will be between one and 100. I then had to add an average score class into the gameDTO so the SQL 
                            Game repository would be able to inherit the average score and will be able to store an average score for later use. I then had to edit every method in the SQL game repository that 
                            involved the user seeing a game's average score.<br><br>
                            
                            Each method had to inherit the get review method in the interface review repository. The get reviews method was used in conjunction with a '.Where' and a 'for each' statement to select
                             reviews that have the same game ID as a game's ID. Each method changed had an added that would add each review's score then divide by how many reviews that fit the criteria, this would
                              find the average score for that game. The methods then use Math.Round() to make the score more user-friendly. In JavaScript files the variable that was used to get a games score was 
                              changed to game.averageScore rather than game. Score. The score table header in the UI got changed to Average score.
