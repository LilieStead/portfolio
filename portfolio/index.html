                        <p class="date">Wednesday 11th October</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday, 11th October the group had a sprint meeting with the product owner. The meeting involved the planning the execution of the first 
                            sprint. The product owner made some requirements and tasks they would like in the solution. The team spoke to the product owner and identified 
                            the tasks that would take more effort than other tasks and tasks that may not be as essential as others. As the scrum leader, I had taken the 
                            leading parts of the conversation and expanded on tasks by asking how they would like specific tasks to be displayed to the user and how they 
                            would like them executed.<br> <br>

                            After the meeting, the group identified tasks that would be dependent on others and prioritized the task. Then we assigned a task based on group 
                            member's strengths and weaknesses. The group decided to take one task at a time so group members could pick another one once done and not have to
                             wait for other group members to finish a task they depended on. My task was to normalize the current database so the platform was no longer static
                              data but rather a foreign key, this would also involve changing and adding multiple files to the existing solution. <br> <br>
                            
                              Then, another group member and I made and tested a git hub repository for the solution, as it will ease the process of group members uploading code
                               at multiple points. Each group member has their own branch that they could make changes to, however, if they wanted to upload changes to the main 
                               solution, then it will need to be approved by another team member to ensure that no changes made will add errors to the main version.<br><br>

                        <h2>peer review, UI redesign & Normalisation of platform </h2>
                        <p class="date">Thursday 12th October</p>
                        <p> Before doing my task, I peer-checked and tested another group member's task before they merged their changes onto the existing solution (their task was to
                             migrate the current solution to entity framework Core), so it needed to be done first before any other task was completed. <br> <br>

                             I then made a more visually appealing and accessible UI to users, and started my task of normalization of the platform in the database and the API. I 
                             redesigned the database so the game table would take a foreign key from a platform table for a game platform rather than using static data for each game
                              platform. I had to remove the existing platform classes in the gameDTO.cs and game.cs and added different classes in them both that would inherit platform
                               information from classes from the new PlatformDTO.cs and Platform.cs. Both files are needed otherwise, platform information will not be gathered, I then had
                                add a DBSET to the GameDbContext.cs so the API could use the PlatformDTO and Platform.cs to make queys. When making the changes. I then had to edit the SQL
                                 game repository as a line was needed to include the platform with the game when outputting data, this was done by using the entity frame work function
                                .include . Finally I needed to make a mapper method to that inherited the both PlatformDTO and the Game.cs that linked them together when they needed to
                                be used in a method. I found an error that prevented the data from going to the front end, so I left it till the next day.

                        <p>I identified the issue regarding the normalization of platform, the issue involved the java script file that fetched the data from the 
                            API to the front end, so I found that the reason the java script want working was due to a the api  presenting that data differently to how it used before the
                            I competed the normalization of platform, to fix this all i had to do was reference the platform name with platform in the java script, then I had 
                            a group member look at my code to suggest any changes and test it to see if it was viable to 
                            the existing solution. Then I merged my changes to the solution</p>

                                 I started my task however due to time constraints I could not completed my task.

                        <p>
                            I have finished the search function and made it so a user can type a game title and the website shows all games with a smiler title. The java script in the front
                            end would not request the data from the API so I had to change the way the java script requests the data. When changing the Game repository I used Abstraction
                            Object-Oriented Programming it has been told to use GetGamesByTitle() from the Game controller and the Game repository to get GetGamesByTitle() from the SQL repository. Ive also made changes to the front end and added vallation so a user can not 
                            enter a NULL name, therefore breaking the program. As of writing i am waiting on one of my peers to review my changes so I can merge them to main. I also used privet variable mapper 
                            so the controller and repository can communicate to the DTO and game.cs. The front end has validation so the user can not enter a blank title and if a user does enter 
                            a blank title then the front end will informed the user that they can not do that.</p>

                        <p>Merge errors happened when two group members merged their code to main as they did not follow the framework, because of this me and another group member had correct and fix all the errors
                            that where made after they merged to the main solution. We had to install all the auto mapper files back to the solution as one user did not use auto mapper, then one group member used the
                            variable User and the other used the variable Users so we had to change all inheritance and encapsulation object oriented programming variable to User. I also had to incorporate everyone's changes into one
                        database as three group members where working on different databases at one time. I then had to test it with everyone's parts of the API to make sure that it was compatible with the whole solution.</p>

                        <p class="date">Friday 27th October</p>
                        <p>When planning to work on displaying the average score against each game I was going to make a method that was could be used in the game controller, however due to how get game by title 
                            works this would not be possible so i opted for changing each current name method to get data on a game.
                            I had redesign the database with two group members changes as they where working on two different databases and it was getting overwhelming to keep track of changes. I also had to remove
                            the score colum from the game table as it would not be needed after I complete my task. <br>
                            Due to the changes made in the database i had to remove any verbile in the Game DTO and Game.cs that resented Score, then i had to use encapsulation oriented programming as 
                            the game SQL repository would need to use the review repository to work out an arrange score, as with out the game controller having assess to review repository it would not be possible. When editing 
                            each method in the SQL repository I had a group member help me when making the code to find the score based on what the method was doing as it was extremely changing. Each method will look through all its games
                            then gets the reviews where the game id matches the game id in the game table, then calculate the average  based on the all the scores taken from the reviews, finally it will round the score for the front end. The only 
                            difference between the get all games method and get games by title method is I had add contains to the line that looks for the game id.
