                        <p>After the group finished the sprint one retrospective we started a sprint two planning meeting to discuss features and improvements we was going to add and complete 
                            for the end of sprint two. There were two main priority when creating tasks for sprint two, one being security and another improving the users experience. One big feature the
                            group had considered is a login feature. With a login feature the user will be logged in through out the whole website. Doing this would get rid of the need for the user to give
                            the front end their user name and password every time they want to submit a form. Other tasks were give to group members based on improvements they could add to their tasks they did 
                            in sprint one. I gave myself tasks that would improve my search game by title task and the geneal UI of the project. Them task where; Search game to not be capital sensitive,
                            Suggestion/Search box and Loading icon while games load. </P>

                        <p>The group isn't fully decided if they want to make a login feature at the moment as time constraints and other assignments may get in the way, and a login feature will
                            make a lot more task such as redesign the UI and make new methods to find a users reviews based on their review, so that is yet to be decided. </p>

                        <p class="date">Saturday 4th November</p>
                        <p>I completed both tasks that I assigned myself to do now (Search game to not be capital sensitive and Suggestion/Search box and Loading icon while games load). To make the loading icon/ animation 
                            I first had to find so-me HTML and CSS that displayed a animated loading icon that suited the UI of the project, then I made some smaller adjustments to it to suit the the 
                            look of the project. Then I had to add a line to the js that displays reviews and games. The line will set the loading icons style to none so its not visible to the user. To make the 
                            search by title none cap stative mapper was just removed from the method and variables that use items form the GameDTO and Game.cs, I have used object oriented principles to achieve this as 
                            it follows encapsulation, everything in them files will used in the method for searching game by title. </P>

                        <h2>Uniform forms, Prevent Duplicate Username on sign up page & no games found</h2>
                        <p class="date">Sunday 5th November</p>
                        <p>I have completed and tested the Prevent Duplicate Username & Uniform forms. To make all the forms look more appalling and uniformed i started by applying all the CSS I made to all the other forms,
                            then I adjusted all the forms that looked smiler to each other the the ui looks more appalling. To complete prevent duplicate username I first had to add to the user controller. I had to make an If statement 
                            that look to see if the GameDM username matched a username in the database, then if it did then return a error code that will be returned to the UI so the user knows why their account couldn't be created. Then
                            adjusted the sign up pages JS so the it would know what to do with the error code, then display it to the user. To get a message to show when no games are not found I first had to add a if statment to 
                            the game controller that looked to see if any games where found and if not then returns not found to the front end where the js will display it to the user, Once I did this I had ran into an error as when testing the task 
                            if a user used a password that another user had the 'username already exits' error would show so I had to inherit the Get user id by name methord from the user controller so I could compare just the user rather than 
                            every field that is in the user table.</h3>

                        <p>After completing the no games found in the search by game title function, I have added a task to do the same when using search review by user name as it would be benefit the user. Adding a 
                            task that tells a user that now reviews where found will be smiler to how I implemented no games to search by title with some small adjustments. </p>
