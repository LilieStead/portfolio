                        <p class="date">Wednesday 1st November</p>
                        <p>After the group finished the sprint one retrospective, we started a sprint two planning meeting to discuss features and improvements we would add and complete for 
                            the end of sprint two. There were two main priorities when creating tasks for sprint two: security and improving the user’s experience. One significant feature 
                            the group had considered is a login feature. With a login feature, the user will be logged in throughout the website. Doing this would eliminate the need for the
                             user to give the front end their username and password every time they want to submit a form. Other tasks were given to group members based on improvements they
                              could add to their sprint one tasks. I gave myself tasks that would improve my search game by title task and the general UI of the project. The tasks where:
                               Search games to not be capital sensitive, adding a star based review system and loading icon while games load. My other tasks included general
                                icons throughout the webpage and the sign-up validation front end and API.</P>

                        <p>The group has not fully decided if we want to make a login feature, as time constraints and other assignments may get in the way. A login feature will make many 
                            more tasks, such as redesigning the UI and making new methods to find a user’s reviews based on the account they are currently logged in as and researching and 
                            implanting cookies or sessions to store user account information.</p>

                        <h2>Search game to not be capital sensitive & Loading icon while games load</h2>
                        <p class="date">Saturday 4th November</p>
                        <p>I completed two of the tasks that I assigned myself to do now (Search game not to be capital sensitive, Suggestion/Search box when using search game by title and
                             Loading icon while games load). To make the loading icon/ animation, I first had to find some HTML and CSS that looked like an animated loading icon that suited 
                             the UI of the project. Then, I made some more minor adjustments to it to suit the project's colour scheme. Then, I had to add a line to any JS files that displays
                              reviews and games. The line will set the loading icons style to none so it’s not visible to the user.<br><br> To search by title, non-cap sensitive, I stopped the method 
                              in the game controller inheriting mapper and instead made the method inherit classes from the GameDTO and Game.cs to find all the game details. I then added another
                               three tasks to do, which was to uniform all forms on the webpage, prevent duplicate username on sign-up page and add a no games found feature where a user can search 
                               for games.</P>

                        <h2>Uniform forms, Prevent Duplicate Username on sign up page & no games found</h2>
                        <p class="date">Sunday 5th November</p>
                        <p>I have completed the Prevent Duplicate Username & Uniform forms. To make all the forms look more appalling and informed, I started by applying all the CSS I made to 
                            all the other forms, then I adjusted all the forms that looked smiler to each other so the UI looks more appalling.<br><br>
                            To prevent duplicate usernames, I first had to add to the user controller. I had to make an If statement that look to see if the GameDM username matched a username
                             in the database. Then if it did then return an error code that will be returned to the UI so the user knows why their account couldn't be created. Then I adjusted
                              the sign-up page and its JS so it would know what to do with the error code, and would display an error to the user. After doing this task I added a new task to
                              validate if an email a user signs-up is already in use, to improve the solutions security. <br> <br>
                              To get a message to show when no games are not found I first had to add an if statement to the search game JavaScript to look to see if data gotten from the API was equal
                              to 0 (meaning no games was found) . If no games were found, then the JS file will make a new table row in the front end and put 'no games found' in it so the user can see. </p>

                        <h2>Validation for sign up form, API validation for same email and fixing the username validation bug fix.</h2>
                        <p class="date">Thursday 9th November</p>
                        <p>After doing completing the username validation so a user can not make an account with the same username as another account, I thought it would be appropriate to do 
                            the same thing with an email. When testing this change, I encountered an error when validating the username as if a user was to copy the same elements (eg. First 
                            name, last name, password, or email) form other accounts then the ‘username already exits’ error would show instead of making a new account. Leaving this error in
                             the API would ruin the user experience as a user could have the first name or last name as another account. To fix this I first had to inherit the Get use id by 
                             name method so we could make a variable that would store details if a user with that username already exists, then I put that variable in and if statement and if 
                             the variable had data in it, then a user with that username already exits and would return an error. <br> <br> 
                            
                             Then to make the API validate a user’s email we first need to add a method to the SQL user repository to get all the users stored in the database, then I made the
                              interface repository inherit the method for later us. Then I made the current method in the user controller inherit the method I added to the interface repository.
                               After than I just used a for each statement in conjunction to that method to look at each user and see if they had the same username or not, and if they did return an
                             error. <br> <br>
                            
                             Then me and another group member that it would be a grate idea if the user was sent any semi-serious error messages (errors sent from the api) through a pop up, so the
                              user had no choice to use it so I just link their Java scripted to the webpage then made some adjustments so it would read the errors straight from the API.<br> <br>
                            
                              Finally, I added front end validation to the sign in page as there was none beforehand. I did this by adding an event listener to the java script so when the submit button 
                              is pressed it will look through all the user inputs and compare then with if statements to see if they match the right formats. If the inputs do not match, then the user will
                               be sent an error through the sine up web page.</P>

                        <h2>Review redesign and star scoring system</h2>
                        <p class="date">Thursday 16th November</p>
                        <p>I made the styling of the review much better and understandable, while doing this, I thought it would be best to implement the star rating system as the reviews will need to display 
                            a star rating.<br><br>

                            I first had to figure out how the stars would look and how they would be displayed. I researched ways to display stars, and I came up with using font Awesome's 4.7 icons. Font Awesome 
                            works by having a style sheet link on all pages so then the HTML can use its custom icons where needed. To aid group members, I added the style sheet link to every page.<br><br>
                            I Started by making a template in HTML and CSS for a review so the group would know what the reviews would look like and suggest any improvements, then I started editing the Java Script.
                             As I already made an HTML template, I opted for using the inner HTML function in JavaScript, as I would only have to make small changes to he HTML. I then had to make a system that
                              would get the number of the average score and convert that into stars, so I made a variable that stored the average score from the API and then compared the score to many if statements
                               and if the score fit in the criteria a verbal called 'star' would store the right combination of icons for that star rating. I then did this for the reviews for the details page as
                                well.<br><br>
                            A similar system was used for searching for games by title and the index game however, because nothing on the pages needed to be redesigned so I only needed to re-use the system used to 
                            find the star combination. So the Java script gets the average score
                            </p>

                        <h2>Login feature meeting</h2>
                        <p class="date">Sunday 19th November</p>
                        <p>Me and another group member decided to have a meeting about the following tasks and decided that we could create a login feature however, when
                             deciding to do a login feature, we realised it would not be an easy task for one person, as it would involve many tasks. Due to how large a 
                             login feature would be to create, my teammate and I decided to split the login task into smaller tasks. We made a branch called the login
                              feature to ensure all changes worked together. Using a branch for both of us can actively test all features will work together. My first
                               responsibility was to make a new header that would show the links in the original header and links to edit details, user reviews, user names
                                and log out. The new header will also make room for the user's username, which would be gotten through my teammate's token task that will
                                 fetch what is needed about the user. We delegated tasks this way so tasks from the login feature can be completed at a quicker pace.<br><br>

                            When planning a login, we made some wireframe diagrams and web structure diagrams as the way the website would work after the changes would be 
                            completely different from how it worked before the login feature. <br><br>
                            
                             While talking about the login feature, we decided to change how the game entity works entirely as it seemed very unsure at the time, as any user
                              could make a game and edit a game without an account. We decided to make games an account must be required. The same goes for editing a game. 
                              Games will now only be able to be changed by the user who made the game. <br><br>

                        <h2>New header with user pages & New index page</h2>
                        <p class="date">Monday 20th November</p>
                        <p> I first had to make a page that let the user choose if they would like to log in or sign up. I started by creating a new HTML file called index.HTML. Because
                             there was a file already called index.HTML I renamed that to home.HTML as home.HTML will be the page users get taken to when they have logged in after I styled
                            the web page. <br> <br>

                            To complete the header, I first tried to edit the existing header; however, that became a challenge as I had to consider existing styling for the current header. 
                            Due to the complications of editing the existing header, I then made a new header from scratch using a new HTML and CSS file as I didn’t have to deal with the complications.
                             Once I completed the base header, I then had to make another nav tag that would be used for the user web pages. I had to make another Nav tag to incorporate the user links
                              into a hamburger menu. To make the hamburger menu disappear and reappear, I had to make a JavaScript file that would change the width so the user could see the hamburger
                               menu and change the width to 0 when the user didn’t want to see it. Once I had the new header done, I had to add it to every page that needed it. <br> <br>
                            </p>

                        <h2>Edit game and make game form validation</h2>
                        <p class="date">Tuesday 21th November</p>
                        <p> After my teammate made/amended both forms to edit and create a game to include game details, I added some validation to the UI so a user could not enter invalid data. The 
                            validation pops up below the input and tells the user why they cannot enter that input. I did this with all fields on each file. For each HTML file, I added a JavaScript file
                             that gets all the user inputs by using the existing function called ‘get element by id’ to get the value of what the user inputted. Then, the JavaScript gets the ID of empty
                              P tags using the same function. Then, each user input goes through if statements that meet the requirements. Before the if statements, there is a variable called ‘blankFields’,
                               and if an if statement is used, it means that the user input is not valid, so the ‘blankfeilds’ variable is made true. Setting it to true means that the JavaScript will not
                                submit the form. If the if statements are used then text will be sent to the blank P tags to tell the user what is wrong with the inputs. <br><br>

                                I also made it so the edit game details form so the JavaScript would bring all the details into the inputs so the user would not have to re type everything. This was done by 
                                gathering all the inputs by their IDs and making them variables, then using the ‘.value’. function to place the data from the API into the inputs. That makes for a pleasant 
                                user experience, as uses do not have to retype a games details if they didn’t want to edit them. <br> <br>

                        <p>To make the API create gamedetails, I first had to add a new method to the SQL game details repository. The new method is called 'CreateDetail,' and it is supposed to add game details to the 
                            database. I then allowed the Interface game details repository to inherit the method I made. Then I made a new method in the game details controller <br> <br>
                            that used HTTP POST and inherited the method I made in the SQL repository via the interface repository. My team member edited my Java Script to send the data to the API. However, the edit game 
                            details still didn't work when testing the code. Later I found out the game DTO needed editing, so the game details are inherited that way the game details can be brought through with the general
                             game data.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p> Me and the group member tested the login branch for any errors that may have occurred when pushing to the branch. After that was fully tested, we merged the login branch to the main version and tested
                             all the changes made with the main branch to see any errors. The only errors that was found were duplicates of lines that git hub added and lines that GitHub deleted when merging. We added and deleted
                              the lines that needed editing, and everything worked fine. <br> <br>
                            I then needed to make acceptable dummy data and delete testing data in preparation for the sprint two retrospective.
