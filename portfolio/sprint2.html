                        <p>After the group finished the sprint one retrospective we started a sprint two planning meeting to discuss features and improvements we was going to add and complete 
                            for the end of sprint two. There were two main priority when creating tasks for sprint two, one being security and another improving the users experience. One big feature the
                            group had considered is a login feature. With a login feature the user will be logged in through out the whole website. Doing this would get rid of the need for the user to give
                            the front end their user name and password every time they want to submit a form. Other tasks were give to group members based on improvements they could add to their tasks they did 
                            in sprint one. I gave myself tasks that would improve my search game by title task and the geneal UI of the project. Them task where; Search game to not be capital sensitive,
                            Suggestion/Search box and Loading icon while games load.

                        <p> The group isn't fully decided if they want to make a login feature at the moment as time constraints and other assignments may get in the way, and a login feature will
                            make a lot more task such as redesign the UI and make new methods to find a users reviews based on their review, so that is yet to be decided.

                            <p>I completed both tasks that I assigned myself to do now (Search game to not be capital sensitive and Suggestion/Search box and Loading icon while games load). To make the loading icon/ animation 
                                I first had to find so-me HTML and CSS that displayed a animated loading icon that suited the UI of the project, then I made some smaller adjustments to it to suit the the 
                                look of the project. Then I had to add a line to the js that displays reviews and games. The line will set the loading icons style to none so its not visible to the user. To make the 
                                search by title none cap stative mapper was just removed from the method and variables that use items form the GameDTO and Game.cs, I have used object oriated prinsables to achive this as 
                                it follows encapsulation, everything in them files will used in the method for searching game by title.
