                        <p class="date">Wednesday 1st November</p>
                        <p>After the group finished the sprint one retrospective, we started a sprint two planning meeting to discuss features and improvements we would add and complete for 
                            the end of sprint two. There were two main priorities when creating tasks for sprint two: security and improving the user’s experience. One significant feature 
                            the group had considered is a login feature. With a login feature, the user will be logged in throughout the website. Doing this would eliminate the need for the
                             user to give the front end their username and password every time they want to submit a form. Other tasks were given to group members based on improvements they
                              could add to their sprint one tasks. I gave myself tasks that would improve my search game by title task and the general UI of the project. The tasks where:
                               Search games to not be capital sensitive, adding a star based review system and loading icon while games load. My other tasks included general
                                icons throughout the webpage and the sign-up validation front end and API.</P>

                        <p class="date">Saturday 4th November</p>
                        <p>I completed two of the tasks that I assigned myself to do now (Search game not to be capital sensitive, Search box when using search game by title and
                             Loading icon while games load). To make the loading icon/ animation, I first had to find some HTML and CSS that looked like an animated loading icon that suited 
                             the UI of the project. Then, I made some more minor adjustments to it to suit the project's colour scheme. Then, I added a line to the JavaScript that that
                              loaded games and reviews in to make the display type none.
                              <br><br> I modified the game controller to search for titles without case sensitivity. Instead of inheriting from the auto mapper, I made the method inherit 
                              straight from the GameDTO and Game.cs to retrieve all game details.</P>

                        <h2>Uniform forms, Prevent Duplicate Username on sign up page & no games found</h2>
                        <p class="date">Sunday 5th November</p>
                        <p>To make all the forms look more appalling and informed, I started by applying all the CSS I made to 
                            all the other forms, then I adjusted all the forms that looked smiler to each other so the UI looks more appalling.<br><br>
                            To prevent duplicate usernames, I updated the user controller with an If statement to check if the entered username matches any in the database.
                             If a match is found, an error code is returned to the UI from the controller, informing the user of the issue during account creation. I then 
                             adjusted the sign-up page and its JavaScript to handle this error code and display a corresponding message to the user.
                            <br> <br>
                              To get a message to show when no games are not found I first had to add an if statement to the search game JavaScript to look to see if data gotten from the API was equal
                              to 0 (meaning no games was found) . If no games were found, then the JS file will make a new table row in the front end and put 'no games found' in it so the user can see. </p>

                        <h2>Validation for sign up form, API validation for same email and fixing the username validation bug fix.</h2>
                        <p class="date">Thursday 9th November</p>
                        <p> After successfully implementing username validation to prevent users from creating accounts with duplicate usernames, I found it appropriate to extend the same
                             validation to email addresses. When testing this change, I encountered an error when validating the username as if a user was to copy the same elements (eg. First 
                            name, last name, password, or email) form other accounts then the ‘username already exits’ error would show instead of making a new account. To fix this I first had
                             to inherit the Get use id by name method so we could make a variable that would store details if a user with that username already exists, then I put that variable
                              in and if statement and if the variable had data in it, then a user with that username already exits and would return an error.<br> <br> 
                            
                             Then to make the API validate a user’s email I first needed to add a method to the SQL user repository to get all the users stored in the database, then I made the
                              interface repository inherit the method for later use by using abstract and polymorphism principles.
                               Then I made the current method in the user controller inherit the method I added to the interface repository.
                               After that I just used a for each statement in conjunction to that method to look at each user and see if they had the same email or not, and if they did return an
                             error.<br> <br>
                            
                            
                            I revamped the API error messages to appear as semi-serious pop-up messages on the webpage. I linked my team members' pop-up JavaScript to the page and made necessary adjustments to directly fetch
                            and display error messages from the API, ensuring users cannot overlook important information.<br> <br>
                            
                              Finally, I added front end validation to the sign-in page as there was none beforehand. I did this by adding an event listener to the java script so when the submit button 
                              is pressed it will look through all the user inputs and compare then with if statements to see if they match the right formats. If the inputs do not match, then the user will
                               be sent an error through the sine up web page.</P>

                        <h2>Review redesign and star scoring system</h2>
                        <p class="date">Thursday 16th November</p>
                        <p>I made the styling of the review much better and understandable, while doing this, I thought it would be best to implement the star rating system as the reviews will need to display 
                            a star rating.<br><br>

                            I first had to figure out how the stars would look and how they would be displayed. I researched ways to display stars, and I came up with using font Awesome's 4.7 icons. Font Awesome 
                            works by having a style sheet link on all pages so then the HTML can use its custom icons where needed. To aid group members, I added the style sheet link to every page.<br><br>
                            I Started by making a template in HTML and CSS for a review so the group would know what the reviews would look like and suggest any improvements, then I started editing the Java Script.
                             As I already made an HTML template, I opted for using the inner HTML function in JavaScript, as I would only have to make small changes to he HTML. I then had to make a system that
                              would get the number of the average score and convert that into stars, so I made a variable that stored the average score from the API and then compared the score to many if statements
                               and if the score fit in the criteria a verbal called 'star' would store the right combination of icons for that star rating. I then did this for the reviews for the details page as
                                well.<br><br>
                            A similar system was used for searching for games by title and the index game however, because nothing on the pages needed to be redesigned so I only needed to re-use the system used to 
                            find the star combination. So the Java script gets the average score
                            </p>

                        <p>In collaboration with a team member, we discussed the issues of implementing a login feature and recognized that it would involve numerous tasks, 
                            making it challenging for one person to handle. To ease the process, we decided to divide the login feature into smaller tasks and created a 
                            dedicated branch for it. Our approach involved active collaboration on the branch to ensure seamless integration of all changes. We then delectated
                             each other tasks for the login feature.

                        <p> I first had to make a page that let the user choose if they would like to log in or sign up. I started by creating a new HTML file called index.HTML. Because
                             there was a file already called index.HTML I renamed that to home.HTML as home.HTML will be the page users get taken to when they have logged in after I styled
                            the web page. <br> <br>

                            To complete the header, I first tried to edit the existing header; however, that became a challenge as I had to consider existing styling for the current header. 
                            Due to the complications of editing the existing header, I then made a new header from scratch using a new HTML and CSS file as I didn’t have to deal with the complications.
                             Once I completed the base header, I then had to make another nav tag that would be used for the user web pages. I had to make another Nav tag to incorporate the user links
                              into a hamburger menu. To make the hamburger menu disappear and reappear, I had to make a JavaScript file that would change the width so the user could see the hamburger
                               menu and change the width to 0 when the user didn’t want to see it. Once I had the new header done, I had to add it to every page that needed it. <br> <br>
                            </p>

                        <h2>Edit game and make game form validation</h2>
                        <p class="date">Monday 20th November</p>
                        <p> After my teammate made/amended both forms to edit and create a game to include game details, I added some validation to the UI so a user could not enter invalid data. The 
                            validation pops up below the input and tells the user why they cannot enter that input. I did this with all fields on each file. For each HTML file, I added a JavaScript file
                             that gets all the user inputs by using the existing function called ‘get element by id’ to get the value of what the user inputted. Then, the JavaScript gets the ID of empty
                              P tags using the same function. Then, each user input goes through if statements that meet the requirements. Before the if statements, there is a variable called ‘blankFields’,
                               and if an if statement is used, it means that the user input is not valid, so the ‘blankfeilds’ variable is made true. Setting it to true means that the JavaScript will not
                                submit the form. If the if statements are used then text will be sent to the blank P tags to tell the user what is wrong with the inputs. <br><br>

                                I also made it so the edit game details form so the JavaScript would bring all the details into the inputs so the user would not have to re type everything. This was done by 
                                gathering all the inputs by their IDs and making them variables, then using the ‘.value’. function to place the data from the API into the inputs. That makes for a pleasant 
                                user experience, as uses do not have to retype a games details if they didn’t want to edit them. <br> <br>

                        <p class="date">Tuesday 21th November</p>
                        <p>To make the API create gamedetails, I first had to add a new method to the SQL game details repository. The new method is called 'CreateDetail,' and it is supposed to add game details to the 
                            database. I then allowed the Interface game details repository to inherit the method I made via encapsulation and Polymorphism. Then I made a new method in the game details controller,
                            that used HTTP POST and inherited the method I made in the SQL repository via the interface repository. My team member edited my Java Script to send the data to the API. However, the edit game 
                            details still didn't work when testing the code. Later I found out the game DTO needed editing, so the game details are inherited that way the game details can be brought through with the general
                             game data.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p>I then had to edit some of the pages that show reviews. To do this, I had to edit the JavaScript files that tell the UI to show the reviews, I allowed the JavaScript I originally made to uses my team 
                            member's token function that will enable the API to find a user userID. It works by looking to see if the userID with each review is the same as the tokenID (the tokenID is the users ID who has logged
                             in). If both are the same, then the Javascript will use the inner HTML function to display the edit and delete options, and if they are not, then options will not show and will only use blank links
                              and won't be displayed.

                        <p>To make the my games page, I re-used the home page as they have similar elements, then to make the Java script that uses a fetch to get all games in the API, but then the Java script will look to see

                        <p> Me and the group member tested the login branch for any errors that may have occurred when pushing to the branch. After that was fully tested, we merged the login branch to the main version and tested
                             all the changes made with the main branch to see any errors. The only errors that was found were duplicates of lines that git hub added and lines that GitHub deleted when merging. We added and deleted
                              the lines that needed editing, and everything worked fine. <br> <br>
                            I then needed to make acceptable dummy data and delete testing data in preparation for the sprint two retrospective.
